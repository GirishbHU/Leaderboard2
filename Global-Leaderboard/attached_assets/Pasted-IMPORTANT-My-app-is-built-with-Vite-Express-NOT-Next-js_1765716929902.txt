IMPORTANT: My app is built with Vite + Express (NOT Next.js).

I need to deploy my Vite + Express app to Namecheap.

My Namecheap hosting has:
- Node.js support (shared hosting with cPanel)
- cPanel File Manager (I'll use web upload, not FTP)
- PostgreSQL database already created
- I want to use my own domain

Here's my actual stack:
- Frontend: Vite + React
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
- Deployment: Namecheap cPanel

**What I need you to do:**

**1. Create a production build:**
   - Run `npm run build` (this creates dist/ folder for Vite)
   - Create dist/ folder (compiled frontend)
   - Keep server.js or your Express entry point

**2. Create a ZIP file called "i2u-vite-express-deploy.zip" containing:**
   - dist/ folder (Vite compiled frontend - this is production-ready HTML/CSS/JS)
   - server.js (or your Express entry point file)
   - node_modules/ DO NOT INCLUDE (too big, I'll install on server)
   - package.json (dependencies)
   - package-lock.json (exact versions)
   - prisma/ folder (database schema)
   - lib/ folder (utilities)
   - public/ folder (static assets if any)
   - .env.production.example (template)

**3. Create a file called "VITE-EXPRESS-STEPS.md" with:**

   **Step 1: Download the ZIP**
   - Download i2u-vite-express-deploy.zip from Replit
   
   **Step 2: Go to cPanel File Manager**
   - Login to Namecheap cPanel
   - Click "File Manager"
   - Navigate to: /home/yourname/nodejs/i2u/
   - (Create folder if it doesn't exist)
   
   **Step 3: Upload ZIP in cPanel**
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select i2u-vite-express-deploy.zip
   - Wait for upload (shows progress bar)
   - Right-click on ZIP → "Extract"
   - Done! All files extracted
   
   **Step 4: Create .env.production file**
   - In cPanel File Manager, click "Create New File"
   - Name: .env.production
   - Paste your database and API keys:
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
     NODE_ENV=production
     PORT=3000
   - Save
   
   **Step 5: Install dependencies (in cPanel Terminal)**
   - In cPanel, find "Terminal"
   - Type: cd /home/yourname/nodejs/i2u/
   - Type: npm install --production
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   
   **Step 6: Sync database (in cPanel Terminal)**
   - Type: npx prisma db push
   - Wait 1 minute
   
   **Step 7: Start app in cPanel**
   - Go to cPanel → "Setup Node.js App"
   - Click "Create Application"
   - App root: /home/yourname/nodejs/i2u/
   - Startup file: server.js (or your Express entry point)
   - Click "Save"
   - Click "Start Application"
   
   **Step 8: Test**
   - Visit your domain
   - Your Vite + Express app should be live!
   - Frontend will be served from dist/ folder
   - Backend APIs will work from Express

**4. Create a checklist "VITE-EXPRESS-CHECKLIST.md":**
   - Have your Namecheap login ready
   - Have your PostgreSQL connection string (host, user, password, database)
   - Have your domain ready
   - Have any API keys (Stripe, Cashfree, etc.)
   - Estimate time: 20-30 minutes total
   - Difficulty: Very easy (just upload and click buttons)

**Important Notes:**
- Vite builds static files to dist/ folder - Express will serve these
- Express backend runs on Node.js
- dist/ folder = your frontend (HTML, CSS, JS, assets)
- server.js = your Express backend (APIs, database connections)
- When you visit your domain, it loads dist/index.html first, then Express handles API routes

**DO NOT:**
- Change my code structure
- Modify database schema
- Include node_modules in ZIP

**At the end, tell me:**
- Correct files to include in ZIP
- Size of the ZIP file
- Which file is the Express entry point
- How Vite + Express will work together on Namecheap

Make it clear for Vite + Express deployment (not Next.js).
