I need to deploy my Next.js app to Namecheap, but I DON'T want to use FTP.

I have:
- Namecheap shared hosting with cPanel
- cPanel File Manager (not FTP)
- PostgreSQL database ready on Namecheap

Here's what I need:

**1. Create a production build:**
   - Run npm run build
   - Create .next folder (optimized production code)

**2. Create a simple ZIP file called "i2u-deploy.zip" that contains:**
   - .next/ folder (production app)
   - app/ folder (source code)
   - public/ folder (images, static files)
   - prisma/ folder (database)
   - lib/ folder (utilities)
   - components/ folder (React components)
   - package.json (dependencies)
   - package-lock.json (exact versions)
   - next.config.mjs (config)
   - server.js (startup script)
   - .env.production.example (template)

**3. Create a file called "NAMECHEAP-SIMPLE-STEPS.md" with:**

   **Step 1: Download the ZIP**
   - Download i2u-deploy.zip from Replit
   
   **Step 2: Go to cPanel File Manager**
   - Login to Namecheap cPanel
   - Click "File Manager"
   - Navigate to: /home/yourname/nodejs/i2u/
   - (Or create the folder if it doesn't exist)
   
   **Step 3: Upload ZIP in cPanel**
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select i2u-deploy.zip
   - Wait for upload (shows progress bar)
   - Right-click on ZIP → "Extract"
   - Done! All files are extracted
   
   **Step 4: Create .env.production file**
   - In cPanel File Manager, click "Create New File"
   - Name: .env.production
   - Paste your database and API keys
   - Save
   
   **Step 5: Install dependencies (in cPanel Terminal)**
   - In cPanel, find "Terminal"
   - Type: cd /home/yourname/nodejs/i2u/
   - Type: npm install --production
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   
   **Step 6: Sync database (in cPanel Terminal)**
   - Type: npx prisma db push
   - Wait 1 minute
   
   **Step 7: Start app in cPanel**
   - Go to cPanel → "Setup Node.js App"
   - Click "Create Application"
   - App root: /home/yourname/nodejs/i2u/
   - Startup file: server.js
   - Click "Save"
   - Click "Start Application"
   
   **Step 8: Test**
   - Visit your domain
   - Your app should be live!

**4. Create a checklist "BEFORE-YOU-START.md":**
   - Have your Namecheap login ready
   - Have your PostgreSQL details ready (host, user, password, database name)
   - Have your Stripe test keys ready
   - Have your Cashfree test keys ready
   - Estimate time: 20-30 minutes total
   - Difficulty: Very easy (just copy-paste in cPanel)

**DO NOT:**
- Create any other files
- Modify my code
- Change my database schema

**At the end, tell me:**
- Size of i2u-deploy.zip
- What to do with the ZIP file
- Clear step-by-step list

Make it SUPER simple - assume user has never used terminal before.
